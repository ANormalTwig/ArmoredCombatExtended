# Armored Combat Framework Extended

The Armoured Combat Framework is a Garry's Mod addon that brings you a balanced, realistic and funny combat damage system, which simulates projectiles, armor and explosions, as well as engines and gearboxes. Unlike than its predecesor, ACE comes to be ACF + ACF Missiles, besides that adds new content and features as well, so means you donÂ´t need those dependences anymore. 

for the older description, open the readme.txt - expect this content in wiki on future.
