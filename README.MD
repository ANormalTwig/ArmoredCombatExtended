# Armored Combat Framework Extended

The Armoured Combat Extended or aka ACE, is an addon that brings you a realistic combat damage system, a several amount of weapons, like cannons, missiles or bombs and a great amount of engines and gearboxes, so you can build one of the most popular stuff on gmod; *tanks and cars*, although you can build whatever you want. To use this addon, wiremod basic knowledge is required.
